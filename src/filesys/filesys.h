 * @brief Header file for the filesystem module.
 *
 * This module provides functions to initialize and manage the filesystem,
 * including writing files to MRAM with buffering support.
 * 
 * Note: Read, delete, and other filesystem operations are implemented in little-fs.
 * Also note that only 2-byte file names are allowed, and so directories are not supported.
 * Files must be uniquely named (2^16 files max).
