            Tasks:
            1) If the command includes "docs" or "doc":
              - Inspect the PR's diff to detect all user-visible changes (APIs, CLI flags, behavior, etc.).
              - **Goal: Generate Brief Update Documentation.** For every file or module affected by the PR.
                - If a relevant documentation file exists, propose an update to reflect the changes.
                - If new user-facing code is added without existing documentation, propose the creation of a **new, complete README equivalent paragraph/section** detailing its purpose, usage, and examples.
              - Tone: factual, concise.

            2) If the command includes "changelog" or "change log":
              - write a faux-CHANGELOG.md per "Keep a Changelog" (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.) in the comments in terse bullets.
              - Summarize PR's user-facing changes in terse bullets (1–2 lines), including the PR number in parentheses when available, and @contributors.
              - If no user-visible changes, add a note under "Changed" or skip.

            Output Policy (Strict):
            - Post a PR comment containing ONLY a summary paragraph followed by a single ```diff fence.
