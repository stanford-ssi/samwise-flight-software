            Tasks:
            
            1) Documentation Updates
               - Inspect the PR's diff to detect all user-visible changes (APIs, CLI flags, behavior, etc.).
               - **Goal: Generate Brief Update Documentation.** For every file or module affected by the PR:
                 - If a relevant documentation file exists, propose an update to reflect the changes.
                 - If new user-facing code is added without existing documentation, propose the creation of a **new, complete README equivalent paragraph/section** detailing its purpose, usage, and examples.
               - Tone: factual, concise.
            
            2) Changelog Generation
               - Write a faux-CHANGELOG.md per "Keep a Changelog" format (Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security) in terse bullets.
               - Summarize PR's user-facing changes in terse bullets (1–2 lines), including the PR number in parentheses when available, and @contributors.
               - If no user-visible changes, add a note under "Changed" or skip that section.
            
            Output Policy (Strict):
            - Post a PR comment containing ONLY a summary paragraph followed by a single ```diff fence with the proposed documentation changes.
